This project is a solution to the problem of predicting the power of a wind farm based on weather data. The find data file parses data from the weather site in the area near the power plant, as well as reading data provided by the company. The prediction file trains boosting models: lightgbm, xgboost,catboost, the model predicts based on the predictions of all three models. In the time row file, neural networks are trained: RNN, GRU, LSTM for forecasting without taking into account meteorological data, that is, based on a time series. In the telegram file, the training is designed in the form of functions.
